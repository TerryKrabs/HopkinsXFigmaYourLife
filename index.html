<!-- Summary: I decieded to go with Naruto because I figured he would provide easy pictures and interesting facts. Making the website on figma was probably the hardest part of this assignment becuase it was very hard to find that middle ground. Either I would shoot too big or way too small. I think were I settled is somewhere in the middle. Trying too translate everything from figma too Html/Css was NOT easy. There were was alot of confusion around trying to keep up with all the lines of code on the screen but after a while you start getting used to it. Overall I think the assignment went pretty well, but unfortuneatly I couldn't get the picture in the navbar the way I wanted to.  -->
<!-- Peer Review: Natalia Cardona: I like the pictures that you used for your background. I don't know much about Naruto but the text next too your images was very informative and it allowed someone who doesn't know anything about the show to get the gist of it.  Your NavBar is a bit generic but overall your assignment looks good! -->
